Noam, higher education in the US is a terribly expensive affair and hundreds of billions
are owed in student loans. First, do you think that a system of free higher education
can coexist alongside tuition-charging universities? Secondly, what could and should be
done about student debt?

\begin{equation}
\lfloor x\rfloor = x -\frac{1}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}
\frac{\sin(2 \pi k x)}{\pi k}

At the other end of the spectrum, at about the same time, the liberal internationalists of the Trilateral 
Commission published their lament over “The Crisis of Democracy” that arose in the “terrible” ’60s, when 
previously apathetic and marginalized parts of the population — the great majority — began to try to enter 
the political arena to pursue their interests. That posed an intolerable burden on the state. Accordingly,
 the Trilateral scholars called for more “moderationin democracy,” a return to passivity and obedience. The 
American rapporteur, Harvard professor Samuel Huntington, reminisced nostalgically about the time when “Truman

This is the real exteriority of the absolute outside: the reality of the absolutely unconditioned absolute outside 
univocally predicated of the dark: the light univocally predicated of the darkness: the shining of the light univocally 
predicated of the limit of the darkness: actuality univocally predicated of the other of self-identity: existence 
univocally predicated of the absolutely unconditioned other of the self. The precision of the shining of the light 
breaking the dark is the other-identity of the light. The precision of the absolutely minimum transcendence of the 
dark is the light itself/the absolutely unconditioned exteriority of existence for the first time/the absolutely facial 
identity of existence/the proportion of the new creation sans depth/the light itself ex nihilo: the dark itself
 univocally identified, i.e., not self-identity identity itself equivocally, not the dark itself equivocally, 
in “self-alienation,” not “self-identity, itself in self-alienation” “released” in and by “otherness,” and 
“actual other,” “itself,” not the abysmal inversion of the light, the reality of the darkness equivocally, 
absolute identity equivocally predicated of the self/selfhood equivocally predicated of the dark (the reality 
of this darkness the other-self-covering of identity which is the identification person-self).

It thus relativizes discourse not just to form — that familiar perversion of the modernist; nor to authorial 
intention — that conceit of the romantics; nor to a foundational world beyond discourse — that desperate grasping 
for a separate reality of the mystic and scientist alike; nor even to history and ideology — those refuges of the 
hermeneuticist; nor even less to language — that hypostasized abstraction of the linguist; nor, ultimately, even to 
discourse — that Nietzschean playground of world-lost signifiers of the structuralist and grammatologist, but to all
 or none of these, for it is anarchic, though not for the sake of anarchy but because it refuses to become a fetishized 
object among objects — to be dismantled, compared, classified, and neutered in that parody of scientific scrutiny known
as criticism.

# On India-Pakistan Relations
This one is not Bulwer-Lytton either, which makes it even more frightening. It was part of story submitted to the rather exacting literary magazine at my alma mater--the first one. After all they never saw fit to publish me, so they must be strict, right?!. It was passed out in a creative writing class as an example of what not to do. I keep this passage taped in my journal to remind myself that no matter how low I sink, at least I'm better than this poor, deluded soul:

"Out of my orifices of vision crept tentitive droplets of salinity as I recalled Mama in the waning days of August, thirty-four summers ago. The tears crawled out softly murmuring, 'We know it's not easy to let us go, but until you do--only then can we flow as a river with an angst-ridden memory and cleanse this face of a pain unforgotten.'
Bouncing along to the rhythm of my sobs, seated near the aft of the bus enrout to work. . ."
There is so much wrong, and so much going on in general, in this passage, that the head swims and I tremble to think what the rest of the work looked like. If you are reading this and this passage is yours, I'm sorry, or actually I'm not. Please, please don't quit your day job.--DanielleOviatt

``Do not weep, gentle programmer, for the system functions have all been heaved relentlessly into the sys package, sitting there silently, alone, in the dark, hoping and praying that maybe one day you, gentle programmer, may once again call them (up).''

In a novel which shall remain unidentified (to protect its author's reputation), we find the following:
On the way out, I stepped on something and looked down. It was a penny. Farther on there were two more. They looked like they had been flung down with some force.
I know the last sentence was written for its humorous effect, but the literal part of me keeps wondering how one can distinguish between a penny that was gently and lovingly placed on the ground and one that was flung with some force. Perhaps the latter was bent by the impact.
It's not Bulwer-Lytton, but still I wince.
