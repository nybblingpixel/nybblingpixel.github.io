# Notes on Mathematics and Computer Science
Running commentaries on various papers, tools and techniques I come across in theory and algorithm engineering 
in pure and applied mathematics and computer science.  

# Demo Literate Programs
Many of the articles in this section have been written as literate programs. 
Concepts in computer science are often at their clearest when explanations are 
weaved into the source (this isn't the same as adding comments!). These articlesa
are a personal experiment in this style of programming.

# Commentaries on various software tools
Want some capsule summaries, code snippets and usage tips of niche tools in the GNU/Linux ecosystem like 
`pandoc`, `m4`, `awk`? You might find something useful here.  

# Everything else...
This section contain opinions, running commentaries on famous books, plays, poems,
various stabs at writing picture prose and notes on topics that have caught my 
fancy over the years.
