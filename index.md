of painstaking astronomical observations, most crucially of the motions of the planets across the sky. 
Johannes Kepler found that these observations could be explained if the planets moved around the sun along 
elliptical orbits, with the square of the orbital period proportional to the cube of the length of the longest 
axis of the ellipse. Newton showed that just such a motion would arise from a universal attraction between bodies 
that was inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. That
